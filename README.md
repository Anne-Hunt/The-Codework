## DESCRIPTION

The Codework, often called The Network, is a social media app allowing current and past students of Boise Codeworks to post and share information with each other. Their posts can include text or images and allow for users to "heart" or "like" posts they see in their feed. The posts are accessed through an API, as are the ads provided by other users advertising their own projects. Users each have a profile page that shows only their content, including their picture and a cover image, their name, their class, and their graduation status. Each user's home page will provide a paginated view of posts sorted by most recent, but allow users to navigate forward and backward through time and other posts.
